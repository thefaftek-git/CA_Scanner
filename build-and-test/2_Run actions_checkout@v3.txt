2025-06-13T03:17:52.5984053Z You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
2025-06-13T03:17:52.5985002Z changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
2025-06-13T03:17:52.5985742Z state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.

2025-06-13T03:17:52.5986491Z If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may

2025-06-13T03:17:52.5988983Z Or undo this operation with:
