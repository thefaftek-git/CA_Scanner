# Troubleshooting Guide

## Overview
This guide provides solutions to common issues and troubleshooting steps for the CA_Scanner project.

## Common Issues

### 1. Authentication Errors
**Issue**: Unable to authenticate to Azure AD.
**Solution**:
- Verify that the Azure credentials (tenant ID, client ID, client secret) are correct.
- Ensure that the Azure app registration has the necessary permissions (`Policy.Read.All`).
- Check the network connectivity to Azure AD endpoints.

### 2. Policy Export Failures
**Issue**: Failed to export Conditional Access policies.
**Solution**:
- Verify that the Microsoft Graph API endpoint is reachable.
- Check the API permissions and ensure the app registration has the necessary scopes.
- Review the error logs for specific error messages and take appropriate action.

### 3. Code Formatting Issues
**Issue**: Code does not adhere to the coding standards.
**Solution**:
- Run `dotnet format` to automatically format the code.
- Review the `CODING_STANDARDS.md` document for guidelines.
- Use an IDE with built-in support for .NET coding standards.

### 4. Test Failures
**Issue**: Unit or integration tests are failing.
**Solution**:
- Review the test output for specific error messages.
- Ensure that all dependencies are correctly installed.
- Check the test configuration and ensure it matches the development environment.

### 5. Performance Issues
**Issue**: The application is running slowly.
**Solution**:
- Review the performance benchmarks and identify bottlenecks.
- Optimize the code and algorithms for better performance.
- Use profiling tools to identify memory leaks or inefficient operations.

### 6. Deployment Failures
**Issue**: Deployment to the production environment fails.
**Solution**:
- Verify that the deployment scripts are correct and up-to-date.
- Ensure that the deployment directory has the necessary permissions.
- Check the application logs for specific error messages and take appropriate action.

## Troubleshooting Steps

1. **Check Logs**: Review the application logs for error messages and stack traces.
2. **Verify Configuration**: Ensure that all configuration files and environment variables are correctly set.
3. **Test Connectivity**: Verify that the application can reach external services (e.g., Azure AD, Microsoft Graph API).
4. **Review Documentation**: Refer to the project documentation for guidelines and best practices.
5. **Seek Help**: If the issue persists, seek help from the community or project maintainers.
