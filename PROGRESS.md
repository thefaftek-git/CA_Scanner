# Implementation Progress

## Containerization and Cloud-Native Deployment (Issue #126)

### Completed Tasks:
- [x] Created optimized Dockerfile with multi-stage build
- [x] Added Docker Compose configuration for local development
- [x] Created Kubernetes deployment manifests
- [x] Built Helm charts for advanced Kubernetes deployments
- [x] Added GitHub Actions workflow for container builds
- [x] Implemented VS Code dev container support
- [x] Updated README with containerization documentation

### Remaining Tasks:
- [ ] Implement health checks in the application code
- [ ] Add monitoring integration (Prometheus, Grafana)
- [ ] Create cloud-specific deployment templates (AKS, EKS, GCP)
- [ ] Implement horizontal scaling support
- [ ] Add resource limit configurations

### Notes:
- The Dockerfile uses a multi-stage build to keep the final image small and secure
  - Changed runtime base image from aspnet to runtime since this is a console app, not a web app
- Environment variables are used for Azure authentication configuration
- Health checks are implemented at the Kubernetes level but should be added to the application code for better resilience
- GitHub Actions workflow supports multi-architecture builds for ARM and AMD64 platforms
- Updated docker-build.yml to use secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME instead of placeholder repository name
