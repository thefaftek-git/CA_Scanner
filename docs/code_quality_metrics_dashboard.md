#EDIT: Create a plan for the code quality metrics dashboard
# Code Quality Metrics Dashboard

## Overview
This document outlines the plan for creating a code quality metrics dashboard to visualize and track key metrics for the CA_Scanner project.

## Objectives
- Provide a centralized view of code quality metrics
- Track progress towards quality goals
- Identify areas for improvement
- Facilitate data-driven decision making

## Key Metrics
1. **Code Coverage**
   - Unit test coverage
   - Integration test coverage
   - Overall code coverage

2. **Code Quality**
   - Number of code smells
   - Technical debt
   - Code complexity

3. **Build and Release**
   - Build success rate
   - Deployment frequency
   - Lead time for changes

4. **Security**
   - Number of vulnerabilities
   - Security hotspots

## Tools and Technologies
- **SonarQube**: For code quality analysis and metrics
- **ReportGenerator**: For generating code coverage reports
- **Grafana**: For visualizing metrics and creating dashboards

## Implementation Steps
1. **Set up SonarQube**
   - Configure SonarQube project
   - Integrate SonarQube with CI/CD pipeline

2. **Generate Code Coverage Reports**
   - Configure ReportGenerator
   - Integrate coverage reports with SonarQube

3. **Set up Grafana**
   - Install and configure Grafana
   - Create data sources for SonarQube and other metrics
   - Design and create dashboards

4. **Automate Metrics Collection**
   - Schedule regular metrics collection
   - Set up alerts for critical metrics

5. **Documentation**
   - Document the setup and usage of the dashboard
   - Provide guidelines for interpreting metrics

## Timeline
- **Phase 1 (2 weeks)**: Set up SonarQube and generate code coverage reports
- **Phase 2 (1 week)**: Set up Grafana and create initial dashboards
- **Phase 3 (1 week)**: Automate metrics collection and set up alerts
- **Phase 4 (1 week)**: Finalize documentation and review

## Acceptance Criteria
- A functional code quality metrics dashboard
- Regularly updated metrics
- Alerts for critical metrics
- Comprehensive documentation

## Next Steps
- Start with setting up SonarQube
- Proceed to generating code coverage reports
- Move on to setting up Grafana and creating dashboards
- Implement automation for metrics collection
- Finalize documentation and review
