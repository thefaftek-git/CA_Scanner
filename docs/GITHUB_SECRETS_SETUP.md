# GitHub Secrets Setup Instructions

## Issue Fixed
The CI tests were failing because they require Azure environment variables for authentication, but these weren't configured in the GitHub Actions workflow.

## Required GitHub Repository Secrets

To make the CI tests pass, a repository administrator needs to add the following secrets to the GitHub repository:

### Steps to Add Secrets:

1. Go to the repository on GitHub: `https://github.com/thefaftek-git/CA_Scanner`
2. Click on **Settings** tab
3. In the left sidebar, click on **Secrets and variables** → **Actions**
4. Click **New repository secret** for each of the following:

### Required Secrets:

| Secret Name | Description | Value Source |
|-------------|-------------|--------------|
| `Azure_Tenant_Id` | Azure AD Tenant ID | Copy from your Azure AD tenant |
| `Azure_Client_Id` | Azure Application (Client) ID | Copy from your Azure App Registration |
| `Azure_Client_Secret` | Azure Application Client Secret | Generate from your Azure App Registration |

### How to Get These Values:

1. **Azure_Tenant_Id**: 
   - Go to Azure Portal → Azure Active Directory → Properties
   - Copy the "Tenant ID" value

2. **Azure_Client_Id**: 
   - Go to Azure Portal → Azure Active Directory → App registrations
   - Find your application → Copy the "Application (client) ID"

3. **Azure_Client_Secret**: 
   - Go to Azure Portal → Azure Active Directory → App registrations
   - Find your application → Certificates & secrets → Client secrets
   - Create a new client secret and copy its value

## Security Notes

- These secrets are encrypted and only accessible to GitHub Actions
- Never commit these values directly to the repository
- The workflow now references these as `${{ secrets.Azure_Tenant_Id }}` etc.

## After Adding Secrets

Once all three secrets are added:
1. The CI workflow will automatically have access to them
2. Tests that require Azure authentication will pass
3. Pull Request #63 should pass all CI checks

## Verification

You can verify the secrets are working by:
1. Triggering a new CI run (push a commit or manually trigger workflow)
2. Check that tests no longer fail with "Missing required environment variables" error
3. All 187 tests should pass in CI (they already pass locally)
