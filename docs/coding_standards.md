#EDIT: Create comprehensive coding standards document
# Coding Standards and Guidelines

## Overview
This document outlines the coding standards and guidelines for the CA_Scanner project. These standards aim to ensure code quality, maintainability, and consistency across the project.

## General Guidelines
1. **Code Formatting**
   - Follow the `.editorconfig` file for consistent formatting.
   - Use `dotnet format` to automatically format the code.

2. **Naming Conventions**
   - Use PascalCase for class names and method names.
   - Use camelCase for variable names and method parameters.
   - Use snake_case for file names and directories.

3. **Code Structure**
   - Keep methods short and focused on a single responsibility.
   - Use meaningful names for classes, methods, and variables.
   - Avoid deep nesting of code blocks.

4. **Comments and Documentation**
   - Use XML documentation comments for public APIs.
   - Add comments to explain complex logic or decisions.
   - Avoid redundant comments that can be inferred from the code.

5. **Error Handling**
   - Use try-catch blocks to handle exceptions.
   - Log errors and exceptions for debugging and monitoring.
   - Avoid swallowing exceptions without proper handling.

6. **Testing**
   - Write unit tests for all public methods.
   - Use mocking frameworks to isolate dependencies in tests.
   - Aim for high test coverage and maintain test quality.

7. **Security**
   - Follow secure coding practices to prevent vulnerabilities.
   - Validate and sanitize all inputs.
   - Use secure libraries and frameworks.

## Code Review Guidelines
1. **Code Quality**
   - Ensure the code adheres to the coding standards.
   - Check for code smells and refactor as needed.
   - Verify that the code is well-documented.

2. **Functionality**
   - Test the changes thoroughly to ensure they work as expected.
   - Verify that the changes do not introduce new bugs or issues.

3. **Performance**
   - Check for performance bottlenecks and optimize as needed.
   - Ensure that the changes do not degrade performance.

4. **Security**
   - Review the code for security vulnerabilities.
   - Ensure that the changes follow secure coding practices.

## Contribution Workflow
1. **Branching Strategy**
   - Use feature branches for new features and bug fixes.
   - Use pull requests for code reviews and merging changes.

2. **Commit Messages**
   - Use clear and descriptive commit messages.
   - Follow the conventional commit format.

3. **Pull Requests**
   - Provide a clear description of the changes.
   - Include relevant issue numbers and references.
   - Ensure that the pull request passes all tests and checks.

## Acceptance Criteria
- The code adheres to the coding standards and guidelines.
- The code is well-documented and easy to understand.
- The code is thoroughly tested and passes all tests.
- The code is secure and follows secure coding practices.

## Next Steps
- Review and update the coding standards as needed.
- Ensure that all contributors follow the coding standards.
- Provide training and resources for new contributors.
